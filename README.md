# Online_Attendance_Tool
Online Attendance Tool provide taking online attendance with face detection. 

Description:

Web-Based Attendance Tool used for online taking attendance with image processing. Instead of classical manual attendance methods, web-based attendance tool that I have developed more technological way for taking attendance. Web-Based Attendance Tool can be implemented on any computer because it is web-server based system. In this application, I used PHP, MySQL, HTML and JavaScript. HTML, JavaScript are used as front-end tools, MySQL and PHP is used as back- end design tools. 

This project cover these specifications; The instructor will take a photo of the class, and upload it to web site. Students will login with their SEHIR University emails, and tag themselves in each lecture's photo. These tags will be recorded in the database as attendance records. Each instructor will login with their SEHIR credentials. Upload the student list as an Excel file at the beginning of the semester. Accordingly, the system will know what classes to show to a student when s/he logs in.
